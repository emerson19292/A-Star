This project is a demonstration/visualiser of the commonly used A* pathfinding algorithm.

It was created just as a fun project.

I wanted to create something with a UI of sorts that lets you make your own mazes etc. for the algorithm to solve.

Just download A*.jar and run it.

There is a good explanation at [https://youtu.be/-L-WgKMFuhE](here) that I used. Other than that one video I did all of the programming myself.
