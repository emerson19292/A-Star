This project is a demonstration/visualiser of the commonly used A* pathfinding algorithm.

It was created just as a fun project, use this however you want.

Just download A*.jar and run it.

There is a good explanation at https://youtu.be/-L-WgKMFuhE that I used. Other than that one video I did all of the programming myself.

There's a visual bug at the end where the line colours go weird, the pathfinding still works fine though.
